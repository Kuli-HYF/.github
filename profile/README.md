## We are

We are a team of web developers interested in contributing in our own capacity with an evergrowing online community. Equality is, without a doubt, one of the most difficult though exciting topics out there these days and we think web development can be used not only to share valuable information with those who need it the most, but also to start building meaningful interactions with a positive impact.
